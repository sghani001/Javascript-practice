Modal/Popup Implementation: Description: Create a button that, when clicked, opens a modal (a popup dialog) on the screen. Use the DOM manipulation techniques to show and hide the modal as needed. Add event listeners to handle closing the modal when clicking outside of it or pressing a close button.

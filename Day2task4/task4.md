Task 4:
Create a function sumObjectValues that takes an object as input and calculates the sum of all its numeric values. The function should handle nested objects and sum their numeric values as well. You may assume that all the numeric values are valid JavaScript numbers.

For example:

sumObjectValues(data);

Output:
36 (5 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 10 + 6)

Interactive Form Validation: Description: Create a form with fields for name, email, and password. Implement JavaScript code to validate the form when the user submits it. The validation should check if all required fields are filled, validate the email format, and ensure the password meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length and complexity). Display appropriate error messages if any validation fails and prevent the form submission until all fields are valid.

Task 3: Write a JavaScript function called countOccurrences that takes an array of elements as input and returns an object representing the count of each distinct element in the array.

For example:

countOccurrences(["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]);

Output:
{ apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }
